# Insense

Insense is an optimization algorithm to select sensors that take linear measurements from a structured (e.g., sparse or near-sparse) signal. Insense finds a small number of the rows of a potenitally large matrix that have small mutual coherence across their columns. The problem is NP-Hard in general. Insense relaxes the objective into a non-conex optimization program and solves it using an itereative-projection method. 

Mathematical details of Insense are provided in the manuscrit in the manuscript ["Insense: Incoherent sensor selection for sparse signals"](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016516841830121X>).
